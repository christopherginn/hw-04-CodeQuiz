## Installation

For installation, this application requires 3 files to be associated together in order to work. 
index.html is coded to display the content.
style.css is coded to style element used in the index.html file.
script.js contains the code for the generate to function and return a randomly generated password to be displayed on index.html.

Place the files in the same repository on Github for easy deployment.

While in the repository, select Settings and then select Pages that appears on the left side. 

On the Github pages screen, select the Branch drop down menu under the Source section and select 'main.' Then click Save. A URL with appear where the site has been published.

## Usage

The quiz is currently incomplete. Questions will cycle through as the user answers the questions and a score is tallied, but there issues with local storage saving for the highschore screen.
